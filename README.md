BrainStation industry 24h hackathon with UX design team

Our challenge: How might we develop a digital solution (or use technology) to support eco-friendly systems and have a greater societal impact in clean energy?

We developed a web app for Site Managers and Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry to sell of excess materials that would otherwise have gone to waste. This is the backend for the project, which runs with a database that is filled with seed "dummy" data for various construction companies selling their waste.
The API allows GET of all listings, GET of all listings of a single company, POST to the listings and DELETE of a listing.
